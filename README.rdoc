This web app began at Lighthouse Labs as a learning project to get acquainted with Rails. We were encouraged to use Bootstrap for styling, and gems such as carrierwave (file uploader) and kaminari (pagination).

After finishing the recommended functionalities and enhancements, I took the project further. The admins for the site can load movies from the Open Movie Database in addtion to manually submit each new movie by filling out a form as regular users do. Utilizing the OMDB API, an admin can load five movies at random each time.

In the future, I plan to expand the movie loading functionality and modify the Movie model to prevent duplicate entries.
